# Chess

Initially, I wrote a very basic Chess implementation in C++ that was entirely text based

Then I ported it over into a JUCE project and made it look prettier:

## Why do this?

Because I wanted to learn C++!


## How to run

Clone the repo, open up the xcode project, and press run

Alternatively, if you don't want to build the project or open xcode, I included a demo build for MacOS. Clone the repo, or download a zip and simple run the ChessGUI Application (located in the top directory).
